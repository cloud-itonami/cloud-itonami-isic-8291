(ns dossier.llm
  "Dossier-LLM client — the *contained intelligence node*.

  It normalizes registry-upsert patches, drafts relationship edges between
  entities, proposes disclosure column sets for a licensed company query or
  a licensed PEP/sanctions name screen, and drafts correction resolutions.
  CRITICAL: it is a smart-but-untrusted advisor. It
  returns a *proposal* (with a rationale + the fields/source it cited), never
  a committed or disclosed record. Every output is censored downstream by
  `dossier.policy` (the DisclosureGovernor) before anything touches the SSoT
  or leaves the actor.

  Like `cloud-itonami-6310`'s HR-LLM, this is a deterministic mock so the
  actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised end-to-end.
  In production this calls a real LLM (kotoba-llm) with the same proposal
  shape.
